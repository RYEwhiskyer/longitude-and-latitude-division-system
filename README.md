# longitude-and-latitude-division-system
Using a combination of longitude and latitude, the inner and outer ring blocks, and the 288 units to establish a spatial structure division system based on the fitting sphere of the femoral head
The codes in ‘WARP 2d-3d’ folder are used to demonstrate the mapping of the planar heat map onto the surfaces of the sphere and ellipsoid to complete a 3D display.
The files in ‘Model’ folder are the standard CAD measurement models of longitude-and-latitude-division-system, their diameters are defined as 42.5mm.
